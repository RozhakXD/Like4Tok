Like4Tok is a Python-based project that helps you grow your TikTok presence by automating the process of getting free followers and likes without requiring you to log in to your TikTok account. Our algorithm bypasses the need for login credentials, making it a convenient and efficient way to boost your TikTok profile.

## How does it work?
Like4Tok uses a combination of web scraping and algorithmic techniques to simulate user interactions on the Like4Like platform, allowing you to earn credits and redeem them for followers and likes on TikTok. Our script takes care of the heavy lifting, so you can focus on creating engaging content and growing your audience.

## Getting Started on Termux
**Note for Termux users (v118 and above)**: If you're using Termux version 118 or later, you can simply run the following commands to get started:
  ```
  $ apt update -y && apt upgrade -y
  $ pkg install git python-pip
  $ git clone https://github.com/RozhakXD/Like4Tok
  $ cd "Like4Tok"
  $ python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
  $ python Run.py
  ```

**Already installed?** If you've already installed Like4Tok, just navigate to the directory and run the script:
```
$ cd "$HOME/Like4Tok"
$ python Run.py
```

## Troubleshooting
- If you encounter any other issues, try restarting the script or checking the Like4Tok GitHub page for updates.
- If you're unable to login, try using Kiwi Browser and Cookie Dough Extension to obtain a new cookie. Make sure to enter the correct cookie.
- If you're not receiving coins, it's possible that the Like4Like system has been patched and this bypass program is no longer functional. As a bypass program, its functionality may decrease over time.
- If your followers or likes are not increasing, it's possible that you entered the wrong link or the Like4Like system is experiencing a bug. Double-check your link and try again.
